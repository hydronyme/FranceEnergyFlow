# FranceEnergyFlow
This work is based on the Energy Flow Charts of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/commodities/energy.
International Energy Agency figures of 2017 (published in 2019) for France are completed by data on energy use from the french government :
- https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/consommation-denergie-par-usage-du-residentiel 
- https://www.statistiques.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/consommation-denergie-par-usage-du-tertiaire

The code is forked from https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey and adapted to have a similar render than the original work of LLNL.
